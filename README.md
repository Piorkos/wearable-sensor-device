# Wearable device for data collection from sensors
This device is a versatile tool designed for collecting and storing data from a gyroscope, accelerometer, e-compass, and GPS. It is intended to be worn on the wrist. 
Hardware components:
- microcontroller RP2040, dual core 32-bit Arm® Cortex®-M0+ @ 133MHz
- IMU (accelerometer and gyroscope) LSM6DSOXTR
- GPS 
- e-compass 
- memory AT25SF128A-MHB-T, 16MB Flash IC

**Note:** The objective was to obtain a working device as soon as possible, hence the code architecture and design are far from perfection.
